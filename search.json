    "text": "About my PhD\nIn my thesis, which I started working on in December 2025, I ask questions about how inequality is related to compensation in education. My focus is on the Norwegian context, using registry data and a variety of methods.\nIn the first paper, I assess how private upper secondary schooling may contribute to compensatory patterns. For instance, does pupils who have previously performed subpar achieve better grades than others by attending private schools?\n\nPlease reach out\nIf you’re interested in working with me, please reach me at oskarg.olsen@gmail.com"
